#### Comprehensive Exercises

1. **Economic Data Analysis**: Given a matrix `economic_data` with columns representing different economic indicators (GDP, inflation rate, unemployment rate) for different quarters, calculate and print the following:
    - The average GDP over all quarters.
    - The quarter with the highest inflation rate.
    - The percentage change in unemployment rate from the first quarter to the last quarter.

```{r}
# Load economic data matrix (provided)
economic_data <- matrix(c(...), nrow = 5, ncol = 3)

# Calculate average GDP
avg_gdp <- calculate_mean(economic_data[, 1])

# Find the quarter with the highest inflation rate
highest_inflation_quarter <- ...

# Calculate percentage change in unemployment rate
initial_unemployment <- economic_data[1, 3]
final_unemployment <- economic_data[5, 3]
unemployment_change <- ...
```

2. **Stock Price Simulation**: Simulate daily stock price changes for a week. Initialize the stock price at $100 and use a loop to update it based on random price changes. Print the stock price at the end of each day.

```{r}
# Initialize variables
stock_price <- 100
days <- 7

# Simulate stock price changes
for (day in 1:days) {
  price_change <- ...
  stock_price <- ...
  print(paste("Day", day, "- Stock Price:", stock_price))
}
```

#### Visualizing Vectors and Tables in R (continued)

##### Importance of Visualizations in Economics

Visualizations are essential tools in economics. They help us understand patterns, relationships, and distributions in data. Bar plots are used to compare categorical data, while pie charts display proportions. These visualizations make complex data more accessible and aid in decision-making.

***Bar Plots for Categorical Data***

Visualize the distribution of favorite subjects among students using a bar plot.

```{r}
# Favorite subjects data (provided)
favorite_subjects <- c("Math", "Science", "History", "Art", "Math", "Science")

# Create a bar plot
barplot(table(favorite_subjects), main = "Favorite Subjects Distribution")
```

***Pie Charts for Proportions***

Illustrate the proportion of budget allocation for different government sectors using a pie chart.

```{r}
# Budget allocation proportions (provided)
budget_proportions <- c(0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1)
sector_labels <- c("Health", "Education", "Defense", "Infrastructure")

# Create a pie chart
pie(budget_proportions, labels = sector_labels, main = "Budget Allocation")

```
