# ECON 57: Introduction to Statistics and Probability for Economists with R Programming

## Lecture 1: Introduction to R Programming - Part I

### Goals
1. Provide working code for reference.
2. Illustrate concepts with economics-related examples.
3. Include exercises for in-class practice.

### Contents

#### Installation and Setup
- Installing R, RStudio, and Markdown.
- Running an R Notebook.

#### Basics of R Programming
##### Variables and Data Types

###### Defining Variables
In R, you can assign values to variables using the assignment operator `<-`. Here are examples:

```{r}
x <- 5
y <- 2.5
name <- "Economist"
is_student <- TRUE
```

###### Data Types

R supports various data types:

**Numeric**: Includes both integers and floating-point numbers.

**Character**: Represents strings of text.

**Logical**: Represents TRUE or FALSE values.

```{r}
# Numeric variables
age <- 30
income <- 50000.75

# Character variable
country <- "Econland"

# Logical variable
is_employed <- TRUE
```

###### Vector

Vector is the simplest data structure we can implement in R. They are sequences of elements of the same data type.

```{r}
# Numeric vector
prices <- c(10.5, 20.3, 15.2, 12.7)

# Character vector
fruits <- c("apple", "banana", "orange", "grape")

# Logical vector
bool_values <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)

```

####### Indexing Vectors

You can access elements in a vector using indexing:

```{r}
# Accessing second element of prices vector
second_price <- prices[2]

# Accessing first three elements of fruits vector
first_three_fruits <- fruits[1:3]
```

##### Conditionals

```{r}
# If statement
if (x > y) {
  print("x is greater than y")
} else {
  print("x is not greater than y")
}

# Economics example: Buying decision
price <- 15
budget <- 20

if (price <= budget) {
  print("Affordable")
} else {
  print("Too expensive")
}

```

##### Exercises

1. Create a variable age and assign your age to it. Print a message saying "You're young!" if your age is less than 30, otherwise, print "You're wise!"

2. Given a vector of GDP growth rates gdp_growth = c(0.02, -0.01, 0.04, -0.005, 0.03), calculate and print the average growth rate.

3. Write a conditional statement to check if a given number num is positive, negative, or zero. Print an appropriate message.
